Projet Final DA Python - Keskonmange ??!

This project is the final project of Openclassromm's Python App Developer Training:  
"What could we eat tonight?" or "I need 3 meal ideas to order the races next week ...". It is to answer these questions of the week that I decided to think of a solution to facilitate this exercise and sometimes avoid some that is to eat too often the same type of food.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone the repository : 

You can use an virtual environment like virtualenv

Install all the necessary packages :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
From now on you can use the Docker-compose commands:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```  
The site is then searchable from the browser with the URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1
```

## Deployment
